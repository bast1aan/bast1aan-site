Place .j2 templates in this directory, to make them automatically publicly availabe in the application through
the URL without .j2 extension, for example:

index.html.j2 (already existing) is available as http://localhost:5000/

bla.html.j2 becomes available as http://localhost:5000/bla.html

subdir/index.html.j2 becomes available as http://localhost:5000/subdir/

subdir/blie.html.j2 becomse available as http://localhost:5000/subdir/blie.html


Templates not resembling pages, like layout, includes etc should be placed in the other `templates' directory.
